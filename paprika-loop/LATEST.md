The last builder's section and the last judge's verdict; paprika-loop/PROGRESS.md holds every session's.

### Judge 3

The `player1` z-fight is already in my verdict under Faults, and in Next item 3 as a fix to make. I'm leaving the verdict as written. The score is 5.6 as the mean of 4, 6, 4, 7, 5, 8 and 5.

SCORE: 5.6

## Iteration 4
**Did** `simStep` player control: a non-AI P1 with no grip is leashed to 2.2 m from the couch (the outward input component is removed). New route-assist before the roll stabiliser: with ≥2 grips and any input held, the couch gets a small impulse toward `route[ci+5]`.
**Saw** Solo `Space`+`D` held 1800 frames: still floor 1. Couch stops at x≈1.46, y .26 (wedged at the base of flight 1 behind the steps, in the look it sits under the first flight). P1 (4.59, 2.68) is still up on the landing, 3 m from the couch with slot -1, so the leash only stops further drift: P1 had already run ahead before the grip loss. 38% still frames at 100 Hz. `look` reports the `player1` z-fight (0.1×0.13 face at (-0.89, 0, 0.45)) and the `stairwell` x=-3.00 pairs. No perf run.
**Next** 1) Find why the couch wedges at x≈1.46 under the first flight (collider shape vs the step solids; maybe lift/round the couch's front edge or add an invisible ramp collider for the couch). 2) Stop P1 getting ahead before the first slip: leash while gripping is only applied once stretch > 1.0, so also check the slip's knock sends P1 up the stairs. 3) Interpolate couch/player positions; fix the `player1` z-fight (polygonOffset); WIN banner untested.
**Open** Floor 2 and WIN are still never reached; the route assist is untested beyond this run.
