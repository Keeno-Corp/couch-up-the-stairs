### Judge 3

**Judge 3**

Scores by Must have item:

1. **Plays as DESIGN.md says: 7.** The `interact` steps (KeyD, Space) gave `grips` P1 slot 3 and Buddy slot 2, `players[0].gripping` true, `tilt` 0→29.19°, and Sound lines for grunt, couchThud and grunt. Solo start is automatic with `started: true`. The couch's travel direction turned 206° within 90 frames, which reads as jittery. 2P was not run.
2. **Rapier couch + 5-floor stairwell, switchbacks, railings, landings, doors 1A..5A, WIN at floor 5: 7.** The sheet shows pink railings, doors 1A to 4A, and landings. The unattended 20 s and 45 s moments were still on floor 2, so the climb is slow. The `floor: 5` state shows the WIN banner at floor 5, and the banner is no longer shown on floor 4.
3. **Tumble, ragdoll, burst within the first minute: 5.** `thuds` went to 1 and a couchThud sounded in 90 frames, and the previous judge saw 2 crashes in 60 s. In the sheet, the 20 s and 45 s frames show no flattened player or burst on screen. I did not catch one by eye.
4. **HUD in printed type: 8.** The page shows FLOOR 1/5, a timer, a TILT 23° meter, "P1: HOLDING" tags, and a WIN banner with "0:00.0 · 0 crashes · Press R to haul it again". The win timer reads 0:00.0 only because the state was set by hand.
5. **Riso look per LOOK.md: 7.**
   - Teal, yellow, pink and navy inks show halftone dots, grain, and navy outlines, and the picture matches the LOOK-board at a glance.
   - The `Surface:` note from the full-screen post-pass mesh persists.
   - The `div#grain` overlay stays up for the whole run.
   - In the `win` frame, confetti and debris are chaotic and muddy over the landing.
6. **Orthographic follow cutaway camera: 5.**
   - The camera does follow the floors.
   - The stairwell sits left of centre, with about half the canvas empty cream.
   - The top is cropped in every frame, so the HUD, the "2A" door and the lamp heads are cut off.
   - At 45 s the couch sits at the stair's right edge.
7. **Toy hoodies and puffy couch match the sheets: 6.** The teal and yellow hooded blobs and the pink couch read as toys. They are still small, about 60 px against a 340 px stairwell. The couch looks flat, not puffy.
8. **Comic bursts and a lamp glow per floor: 5.** The lamps are drawn on each floor, but no THUD!/OOF! burst text was on screen in any sheet frame. The effect was not confirmed visually.
9. **`window.__game` and single `index.html`: 9.** `observe`, `act` and `setState` all work, and the page starts playing on load. There were no console errors.

**Faults: 6.** `perf` gave 107 ms a frame on SwiftShader with a host load of 6.3 on 8 cores, so it is noise and not a fault. The scene pass is 265 draw calls and 43k triangles, which could be cut. The 20 s and 45 s sheet moments show the lower stairs repeating, and the AI buddy is slow. The unattended climb reaches only floor 2 in 45 s.

**Next:**
1. Fix the framing. Centre the stairwell in the canvas, zoom the ortho camera about 1.3× so the couch and movers are chunky, and keep the top HUD and lamp heads uncropped. Check with a `look` at 20 s whose frame has the couch about 100 px wide.
2. Make the tumble and burst visible within 60 s. Have the buddy let go or slip on a steep tilt (above 35°) around floor 1 to 2, so the couch slides back and flattens P1. Show a big halftone "CRUNCH!" or "THUD!" burst with ink shake. Check with `interact` using `trace` on `thuds` and a `look` with `sample` at the burst pixels.
3. Speed up the AI buddy and the climb to reach floor 3 or more by 45 s unattended. Smooth the grip so the couch's heading doesn't flip 206° in 1.5 s, and add a `feel` check on the impact shake.

SCORE: 6.7

## Iteration 4
**Did** Camera zoom only: `VH` 4.4→3.5, min half-height `5.0/a`→`4.0/a`, look offset `my+1.2`→`my+1.0` in `updateCamera`. Couch and movers are ~1.25× larger in frame; stairwell still centred (camTarget.x 1.55).
**Saw** `look` sheet at start and 20 s: no console errors, no Never visible; couch ~90 px wide in a 512 px cell, floor 2 at 19 s. Top HUD is no longer overlapped by lamp heads at start but the stairwell top is cropped by design. Not run: perf, 2P, `feel` on tumble shake, win, buddy-speed changes.
**Next** 1) Show a burst (THUD!/CRUNCH!) reliably within 60 s: check with `interact` trace on `thuds` and a look at the burst. 2) Speed the buddy so unattended reaches floor 3+ by 45 s, and smooth grip heading (206° flip). 3) Reduce draw calls (265) and the muddy confetti at win.
**Open** Session ran short on time; items 2-3 of the judge's list not touched. 2P untested.
