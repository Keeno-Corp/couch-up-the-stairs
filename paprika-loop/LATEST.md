The last builder's section and the last judge's verdict; paprika-loop/PROGRESS.md holds every session's.

## Iteration 2
**Did** (1) `camOff` (.8, 2.6, 6.2): the couch is 7.9% of the opening picture (was 2.4%), orange 91% of the object pixels. (2) Added `mRailNear` (opacity .18, depthWrite false) and used it on every near-edge railing bar/post/slopeBox at z = ZF-.05, so no railing hides the couch. (3) Moved the `couch` seat cushions (.76 wide, x ±.385) and back cushions (.74 wide) off the shared x = -0.30 plane; the Surfaces warning for `couch` is gone from the latest looks. (4) Lowered the buddy-slip trigger on tag L0F1 from prog .42 to .2.
**Saw** Page runs, no console errors. The opening `look` shows the couch, the red P1 and the 1A door, with no railing in front. The only Surfaces line left is the `stairwell` BoxGeometry pair at x = -3.00, turned away from the camera. `rightWall` is still never visible. In solo, `Space` held from load, then `D`: the single grip is capped at 32 (`fmax` when `gripCount` < 2), so the couch only moves once the buddy also grips; with `D` held, P1 outruns the couch, loses grip ("WHOA! Lost grip!"; STRETCH 1.6) and walks to (5.82, 2.68), which is the solo P1 oddity the judge saw. `slips` and `crashes` stayed 0 in every 600-frame run, because they never reached the stairs, so the slip change is untested. Couch drifts back to x -1.8 with only the buddy gripping.
**Next** 1) Make solo playable by a plain hold: have the buddy grab the nearest free slot immediately (`aiDelay` 3.0 is long) and let P1's `D` only walk while the stretch is under ~1.2 so P1 does not run off; check with `interact` `until: {"floor": 2}`. 2) Then confirm the L0F1 slip shows `slips` 1 and a `rag` state, and play on to floor 5 and WIN. 3) Interpolate couch/player positions between physics steps (38% still frames at 100 Hz); dust and shake on thuds; fix the `stairwell` x = -3.00 pair.
**Open** No play past floor 1 yet; solo P1 grab/stretch flow above is the blocker. Tumble clip not reproduced this session.

### Judge 2

**Judge 2 verdict: the camera item is fixed and the picture is much better. Solo still can't be played past floor 1, so no tumble or WIN has been seen.**

Scores:
1. **Plays as DESIGN.md's Core loop and Controls say: 5.**
   - Solo: `Space`+`D` leaves the couch at x -1.92 (`couch.pos`) with `speed` 0.03, and `thuds` 1.
   - Solo: `P1` is stuck at (5.82, 2.68), `grips[0].slot` -1. Only `Buddy` grips (slot 2). This is the same blocker as last session.
   - Local 2P: `Digit2` with `D`, `ArrowRight`, `Space` and `Enter` carries the couch to (4.62, 2.98) with both `HOLDING`. The floor stays 1 after 1500 frames, `tilt` is 17.9, and the couch stalls at the turn.
2. **Rapier couch and 5-floor stairwell: 6.**
   - The `stairwell` shows switchbacks, railings, and doors "1A" and "1B".
   - Floors 2 to 5 and the WIN landing have not been reached in any run.
3. **Slide-back/tumble knocks players into ragdoll: 3.** `slips` and `crashes` stayed 0 in both runs, and no player left `stand`. The slip trigger at tag L0F1 is still untested.
4. **HUD (timer, Floor n/5, tilt meter, WIN banner): 7.** `div#tl`, `div#tilt` and `div#grips` read clearly with no overlap. The WIN banner has not been seen.
5. **Looks as LOOK.md says, characters per CHARACTERS.md: 7.**
   - Check 2: the couch is 7.9% of the solo picture and 7.1% in 2P, orange at 91%, with no railing over it.
   - Subject brightness is 50% against 28% around it.
   - The red and blue hooded players read clearly.
   - A dark void still takes the left or right edge, about 15% of the frame.
6. **window.__game, starts on load, one index.html: 8.** `observe` and `act` work, there are no console errors, and the page starts on load.
7. **Faults: 6.**
   - The `couch` z-fighting line still shows in the opening look (x = -0.30, 0.71 × 0.07). It is gone in the 2P look.
   - The `stairwell` pair at x = -3.00 is out of view.
   - `rightWall` is never visible in the solo look.
   - Motion at 100 Hz: the couch stands still on 38% of frames.
   - `perf`: 211 ms median on a software renderer with host load 1.2, which is not a budget signal. 413 draw calls is high.

Next:
1. **Make solo playable by a plain hold** (asked again). `P1` is stuck at (5.82, 2.68) in solo.
   - Spawn `P1` beside the couch.
   - Have the buddy grab at once and drop `aiDelay`.
   - Stop `D` from running `P1` away from the couch (lose grip at STRETCH 1.6).
   - One tool call shows it done: `interact` with `Space` and `D` held, `until: {"floor": 2}`. When done, the floor reaches 2 and `P1` has `grips` slot ≥ 0.
2. **Get the couch past the first turn and show the tumble clip.**
   - In 2P the couch stalls at (4.6, 2.98) with `tilt` 17.9.
   - Make the buddy slip at that turn on a seeded timer, so `slips` goes to 1.
   - Use a `sheet` of moments, with the couch sliding back and a player in `ragdoll`, then up again.
   - One `interact` trace of `slips` and `players.0.state` over 900 frames shows it done.
3. **Play to floor 5 and show the WIN banner.**
   - Use `interact` with `until: {"floor": 5}`.
   - Then add juice: `shake` on a thud, `burst` dust, and interpolation of couch and player positions to remove the 38% still frames.
   - Also fix the `couch` x = -0.30 z-fight in the solo opening look and the `stairwell` x = -3.00 pair.

SCORE: 6.0
